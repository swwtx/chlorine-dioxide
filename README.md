# Chlorine dioxide spreadsheet scheduler

(Note different terms for chlorine dioxide: 'MMS', 'Sodium Chlorite Solution', 'CDS')<br><br>
The ChlorineDioxideScheduler.ods file is a spreadsheet that calculates the suggested days to take MMS for ridding the body of parasites. The file runs on the freeware program Libre Office. It may run on other office software also. Once Libre Office is installed on your computer, you can open the file with it. Follow the instructions at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

Click on the 'MMS spreadsheet (Latest)' link on the right side of this page<br>
